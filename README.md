# TitanicFlask

This Flask application utilizes WTForms, a flexible forms validation and rendering library for Python, as well as the popular Bootstrap framework for developing responsive, mobile first web applications. IBM's Watson Machine Learning APIs are employed to make predictions against a deployed machine learning model created using Spark MLlib. The model utilizes Logistic Regression binary classification to predict whether an imaginary person, whose personal information you input, would have survived the Titanic.

An instance of the application running on IBM Bluemix can be accessed at https://titanicprediction.mybluemix.net
